# This file is the dummy monitor for the quark-se-devboard. It reads its
# temperature sensor each 10 seconds, and update OIC monitor server with
# new readings.
# It also sets FAILURE state after pressing 'btn_failure' button. Note that
# button only sets FAILURE state to true - one needs to use monitor client
# terminals to dismiss the FAILURE state.
